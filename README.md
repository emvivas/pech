<b>PECH, a Xun치n Kab story.</b><br><br>
"PECH, a Xun치n Kab story" is a video game developed in Python pygame for helping children to improve readiness skills. Pech is the name of our protagonist bee and the title of our video game. Its history is based on a real event, an event that happened in Mexico in 2011. Without a doubt, the event that will be presented below represents the ability of different peoples to defend and promote environmental preservation, as well as the right of all individuals to fully develop in a healthy and safe environment.

Leydy Pech is an indigenous Mayan woman who is a beekeeper, lover, and caretaker of bees, particularly the endangered native species, Xun치n Kab. She is a representative leader of her community in favor of the defense and representation of the Mayan people. In 2020, she was awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize for her work against the cultivation of transgenic soybeans in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico.

We believe that the central story of our video game should honor this important historical event in order to be disseminated to the general population, especially infants. To do this, we will involve the user in the daily life of a Xun치n Kab bee, one of the hundreds of worker bees who belong to a specific colony, at the moment of which the effects of the transgenic planting of giant corporations. The story will involve situations in which the player must reflect since each action they choose will modify the course of the game's story.

By using the software, the user will get involved with the topics that will enrich her experience and contribute to the constant practice of reading comprehension and mathematical reasoning. That is why the various challenges that will be presented throughout the video game will be related to the reagents of the OECD Program for International Student Assessment.<br><br>
